# 🎉 START HERE - Monorepo Setup Complete!

Your Task Manager project has been successfully converted to a monorepo! Here's where to go next.

## ✅ What Was Done

Your project is now organized as a **pnpm workspaces + Turborepo monorepo** with:

```
✅ Root configuration (pnpm-workspace.yaml, turbo.json)
✅ Three packages (ui, utils, types)
✅ One app (web - your Next.js application)
✅ Updated imports (all using @task-manager/*)
✅ Comprehensive documentation
```

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Step 2: Start Development
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` - your app should work exactly as before! ✨

### Step 3: Done!
Everything is ready. Your monorepo is live.

## 📁 What's Where

| Need | Location |
|------|----------|
| Your app code | `apps/web/` |
| UI components | `packages/ui/` |
| Utilities | `packages/utils/` |
| Types | `packages/types/` |
| Docs | This directory |

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)
1. **Run `pnpm install`** to install all dependencies
2. **Run `pnpm dev`** to start the development server
3. **Verify it works** - Check that the app runs

### Soon (Recommended)
4. **Read QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Learn the commands
5. **Test development** - Make a small change and watch HMR work
6. **Review imports** - See how @task-manager/* packages are used
7. **Optional: Run CLEANUP.md** - Remove old root directories

### Later (Nice to Have)
8. **Update CI/CD** - If you use GitHub Actions, update to use pnpm
9. **Share with team** - Send them QUICK_REFERENCE.md
10. **Start adding features** - Work as usual!

## 🔍 Verify It Works

```bash
# Should install all dependencies
pnpm install

# Should start dev server on http://localhost:3000
pnpm dev

# Should show success
pnpm build

# Should show no errors
pnpm lint
```

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Workspace Links
Packages reference each other using `workspace:*`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@task-manager/ui": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```
✅ Instant updates during development
✅ Full TypeScript support in IDE
✅ No build step needed

### Turborepo Caching
Speeds up your builds by caching dependencies:
- First build: normal speed
- Subsequent builds: ⚡ much faster

### pnpm Workspaces
Manages all packages together:
- `pnpm install` - installs for all
- `pnpm dev` - runs all dev servers
- `pnpm build` - builds all packages

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I work differently now?**
A: No! Just run `pnpm dev` and work as usual. The monorepo is transparent.

**Q: Why monorepo?**
A: Shared components/utils across apps, better organization, easier scaling.

**Q: What if I break something?**
A: `git restore .` or just `git checkout` if you committed.

**Q: Can I still use npm?**
A: No, this setup uses pnpm. It's faster and better for workspaces.

**Q: How do I add a new package?**
A: Create `packages/new-name/package.json` and pnpm auto-recognizes it.

**Q: What's Turborepo?**
A: Makes builds faster with caching. Optional but recommended.

pnpm dev                    # Start all dev servers
pnpm dev --filter=web     # Start just the web app

# Production
pnpm build                  # Build for production

# Quality
pnpm lint                   # Check code quality

# Maintenance
pnpm clean                  # Remove build artifacts
pnpm install               # Install dependencies
```
